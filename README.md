# Rose Coates, Running/Weightloss/Life Coach
## By: Lela Smith

### Description
#### For my capstone I will be creating a new website for my client, Rose Coates. Rose is a Running Coach, Weightloss Coach and now a Certified Life Coach who is really getting her brand and personal business off the ground. For the last 10 years she has been the owner of SportyDiva, an organization that supports women in their fitness and weightloss goals and hosts organized runs all over the Pugeot Sound area. In the last year has also started Keto-ish Girl, a company that helps women meet their health goals through following the Keto diet in a sustainable way that is flexible with their lifestyle. She is now a certified Lifecoach and this website will be a landing pad for her brand combining all three avenues into one cohesive site. The site will have a beautiful and informative interface that can easily be navigaged by users. Users will be able to schedule appoints with Rose and receive email confirmation of appointment. Site will have authentication and the admin will be able to add, update and delete upcoming events and see list of scheduled appointments. Stretch goals include displaying social media and having branded products for sale.
